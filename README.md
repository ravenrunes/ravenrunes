  <h1>👋 I am @ravenrunes 👋</h1>
I have been been a lurker on the internet for over <b>15 years</b>, and in <i>February 2025</i>, I finally convinced myself to share my passion with others. I am <b>not</b> attempting to be the most correct or well-produced content creator on the platform, but I do want to take you along with me and discover what horrors 👻, insights 💡, and experiences 👾 lurk beneath a seemingly simple problem. ✨

  <h1>📂 Projects? 📂</h1>
I have worked on plenty of projects over the years, though only a few of them have made it onto the internet. This is due to me; I frequently take the lure of perfectionism, which was and continues to be a key obstacle of my existence that I must, unfortunately, grow to deal with over time. Wish me good success 😉.

  <h1>❓ Why Occultism ❓</h1>
  <h4> 💻 + 🔮 + 🌐 = ❓</h4>
  <p>
First and foremost, I chose this theme because, at the time, the idea of linking technological subjects like programming or solving problems in the context of an entirely nonsensical pseudo-science seemed like a curious idea to explore.
    Mainly because we, as humans, might perceive problems with a mysterious aspect to be intriguing. The creepypasta<sup>[1]</sup> phenomenon, which swept the internet years ago, was based on a similar concept.     
  Many ideas can be inherently unappealing for people; experiencing these true yet fascinating ideas could spark their curiosity in the topic ⚡.
 With my projects, I aim to provide yet another way to get individuals interested in the sublime art of <code>#critical-thinking</code>, <code>#problem-solving</code>, and <code>#programming</code>.
